    "# A Commentary on the HDF5 File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, no knowledge of the low-level byte layout is needed for the successful deployment of HDF5 data containers in your application or environment. Indeed, the number of HTTP requests directed at the [HDF5 File Format Specification](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) is a miniscule fraction of the requests directed at, for example, the [HDF5 Reference Manual](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5Front.html). Both documents give almost opposite, but certainly complementary views of what we call an *HDF5 file*. From the perspective of the API, it remains somewhat mysterious how all those high-level abstractions (groups, extendible datasets, attributes, etc.) are ultimately arranged and manipulated in a linear byte stream. Conversely, how can this \"digital DNA strand\" reliably be translated back into recognizable objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this sequence of articles is twofold: Firstly, I would like to convince you, dear reader, that the file format specifiction is a mystery-free and rather accessible document, which describes in unambiguous terms what's really in an HDF5 file. Secondly, I would like to help you appreciate what the HDF5 library does beyond merely implementing readers and writers conforming to the specfication. Just fishing around for a few bytes in an HDF5 file is what we do here, but a library it doth not make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have no ambition for a library, and this is a purely (data-)touristic endeavor, we choose an environment that lets us focus on the problem at hand, and that doesn't distract with concerns over representation, or noisy syntax.\n",
    "I believe the combination of Jupyter notebooks with Common Lisp offers an entertaining and concise mixture, but I'll let you be the judge of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "A Docker container that includes all the dependencies to run the notebooks in this series is available for [download](https://hub.docker.com/r/hapax/hdf5-works/). It includes:\n",
    "- A [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook server\n",
    "- The [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/) (SBCL) compiler v1.3.3 \n",
    "- Frederic Peschanski's [`cl-jupyter`](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter)\n",
    "- The [`hdf5-cffi`](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5-cffi) Common Foreign Function Interface (CFFI) wrapper of the HDF5 library  \n",
    "- [`alcove`](https://github.com/HDFGroup/alcove), a small collection of auxiliary Lisp functions developed for this blog  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we refer to 'the specification' in this document, we mean the [HDF5 File Format Specification](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading the Superblock of an HDF5 File\n",
    "\n",
    "As is common in many other file formats, every HDF5 file starts with a file format signature followed by a so-called [*superblock*](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#Superblock), a small piece of metadata with just enough information to get started. For simplicity, we'll create a bare-bones HDF5 file, but you should feel free to use any of your own HDF5 files for this exercise."
